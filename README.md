The purpose for this website is to see the time on your browser tab without needing the taskbar on your Windows or Linux operating system.

Additionally, it offers a toggle option to switch to fullscreen mode by simply clicking on the displayed time.

You can customize your window by changing the color mode in light or dark, select a variety of fonts and toggle either the 12- or 24-hour time format.
